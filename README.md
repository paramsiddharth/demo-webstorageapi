# Demonstration - HTML Web Storage API

A demonstration of the use of HTML Web Storage API using JavaScript. This example demonstrates the use of the `localStorage` variable only. `sessionStorage` may be used in a similar manner for session storage.

It is recommended to check for the availability of the API before usage by enclosing the code in an `if` block with `storage` as the condition.
